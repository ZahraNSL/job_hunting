## [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/) resume template

- Found a couple of nice [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/) templates(a [short](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/adarijani/job_hunting/main/LaTeX_templates/short_resume/short_resume.pdf) and an [extended](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/adarijani/job_hunting/main/LaTeX_templates/extended_resume/resume.pdf) one). Check them out and see if they fit your style.

If you found them to be useful then:

- for the compilation you need a pretty big [TeX](https://tug.org/index.html) distribution to be sure you have all the workflows like [LuaTeX](https://www.luatex.org/) and others. For me on macOS it is called [MacTeX](https://www.tug.org/mactex/)  distribution.

The following lines with compile your short/extended resume(depending on the directory you are on) and pushes the changes into your git repository.

```sh
auto.sh
```

## Job Fair Catalogs

Bonding is an organization that organizes cost-free events for students to allow them to get an inside view of the working world. Companies/Students get to demonstrate themselves in their events which is nice. Here are the compiled catalogues of the companies that participated in different events throughout Germany. The good thing about it is that well it is list and it also give a short description of the company, the revenues, and also the fields that they are recruiting talents from.

## MISC

- THE HANDBOOK(In Farsi Unfortunately) [pdf](https://www.locomo.tips/e/locomo.tips_0.1.3.pdf)
